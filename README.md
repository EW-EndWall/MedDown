With this python project, you can download video and audio from youtube. In addition, the download feature from different sites can be added in this project in the future. I didn't add the other features that I thought to add because pytube was causing problems. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't... Since I didn't have time, I didn't deal with api works myself.

Warning:
pytube was used for download, so it has problems..

Features
  - easy linking
  - audio download
  - video download
  - batch download
  - single download
  - select download location
  - bulk delete
  - single delete
  - media name change
  - show total media count
  - show media time
  - show channel name

I gave up for now because the features I was thinking of adding were problems with pytube.

Some features to add
  - select quality
  - delete download
  - slow download
  - update system
